British rule in India began in 1757 when, following the British victory at the Battle of Plassey, the English East India Company began exercising control over the country. The East India Company ruled India for 100 years, until it was replaced by direct British rule (often referred to as the British raj) in the wake of the Indian Mutiny in 1857–58. The Indian independence movement began during World War I and was led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who advocated for a peaceful and nonviolent end to British rule.

    FREEDOM FIGHTERS
                    </h1>
<p>
     Around 75 years ago, on the historic date of 15th August 1947,  India became free from British domination. It was the culmination of numerous movements and struggles that were rife throughout the time of British rule including the historic revolt of 1857. This independence was achieved through the efforts of many revolutionary Indian freedom fighters, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, and more, who took the lead in organizing the struggle which led to India’s independence. This blog brings you the Indian freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives to ensure India’s independence.

    Born on 2nd October 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation for his immense sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.

     One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than Subhas Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.

    Vallabhbhai Patel was born on 31st October 1875. A senior leader of the Indian National Congress, he had an immense contribution to the Indian freedom struggle as one of the most influential and strong-minded Indian freedom fighters. He was one of the most influential leaders of Gujarat, who organized peasant movements against the British based on Gandhi’s ideals of non-violence. One of the first congress leaders to have accepted the British plan of partition for India, he is remembered for his role in integrating the princely states into the dominion of India. His efforts led to the integration of around 562 princely states. After independence, he served as the first home minister and deputy prime minister of India.
